        <description>
		    <p class="flavor">Experimented live in the shadows of normal life. Under heavy disguises they attempt to live their life. Even if it can never be the same.</p>
		    <h4>CREATED FROM GREED</h4>
		    <p>Experimented are the results of experiments gone wrong, or they are sometimes purposefully created. However, in almost every case they are created in an attempt to create the perfect being. Sometimes the Experimented mutated themselves in an attempt for fame and power. Other times they were simply people who had their lives taken away by the cruel warlocks who created them. Rarely do these people show their faces, but instead hide behind masks to cover their disfigurement. But one cannot hide forever.</p>
            <h4>HORRIFIC APPEARANCE</h4>
		    <p>Experimented are a mixture of several different races. Because of this they will have the appearance of many  races at once. In some cases the disfigurement is mild and easy to hide. In most, it is overwhelming, covering the entirety of the body. Read the appearances of the races your Experimented is mixed with, and find a balance that fits your character.</p>
		    <h4>EXPERIMENTED TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Experimented possess the following traits.</p>
