        <description>
		    <p class="flavor">Orajans are the draconic race of the desertous land of Oraja. Practitioners of magic and mystery, the Orajans are a wandering people who roam the desert sands with skill and ease. Though once believed to have been locked in a holy war with Arta and his people, the Orajans seem disinterested in ever unifying under one banner again.</p>
		    <h4>APPEARANCE</h4>
		    <p>Orajans are not dissimilar to humans in height and weight. Standing between 5 to 6 feet on average and weighing somewhere between 150-250 pounds. Their skin tone ranges from paler olive to darker tans and brown, and their hair color is almost always in the darker range of browns, blacks, and sometimes purple. Almost all Orajans have heterochromia (a condition where they have two different colored eyes), and cultural significance has been made on both the placement and color of each. Shades of each color will represent how pronounced the trait is. Outside of their transformed state, Orajans have one set of dark scaled wings which constantly stick out near the shoulder blade. However, when startled, a second set of wings nearer to the base of the ribs will pop out.</p>

            <h4>AN UNJUST WAR</h4>
		    <p>Orajans trace their history back to a war they waged with the Nagean people many millennia ago. The historical context to this war has been lost to time, but many Orajans cite this as the reason they have become such a scattered people. Continued blame is placed on Arta, the Conqueror, and his people for the loss of civilization and near genocide of the Orajan people. </p>
            <p>Though the present cannot blame Arta completely for the sour luck that has befell Ora's people. Humans have moved into Oraja and have laid claim to much of the land the dragons once held. And the loss of life for land claims is soon to reach just as high as the loss to the Conqueror.</p>
            <h4>SUPERSTITIOUS TO A FAULT</h4>
		    <p>Orajans have many beliefs and hold to those beliefs tightly. Proverbs and idioms are treated as gospel within the clan structure. Some such beliefs revolve around the eye color of an individual. It is believed that every Orajan has a negative and a positive trait represented in their eye color. The left eye represents the negative trait and the right represents the positive. The stronger the color, the more pronounced the trait it gives shall be. Having two of the same eye color is considered unlucky (the two traits will cancel each other out and leave the individual with no personality at all) and it's believed that a parent can only pass down an eye color of the eye(s) they currently have. As such, missing eyes are believed to remove that trait from the individual. A left eye gone is often heralded as overcoming the negative trait, while a right eye gone is a curse to only wallow in that negative trait.</p>
            <h4>A FAMILY TO THE EAST AND WEST</h4>
		    <p>Orajans are organized in tightly knit groups called Clans. A Clan comprises several families. When a couple has a child, it is rare that the child would be raised by their parents alone. Often the Clan will pick up slack and bear the burden of child rearing together.</p>
            <p>As fertile land in the West becomes a commodity, many Orajans have sought refuge Eastward in the land of Contan. Warring human civilization and opposing Clans leave little choice for many but to flee. Trekking through Arity is dangerous, Nageans and Arityian humans are not known for their hospitable nature when it comes to Orajan refugees. Survival rates on these journeys are low, but those who make it are greeted by the established Clan within Contan. A far more united unit, Contanian Orajans will sponsor citizenships for incoming refugees and take in those who were lucky enough to survive the journey Eastward. </p>
            <h4>ORAJAN NAMES</h4>
			<p>Traditional Orajan clan names are derived from the main profession of the clan. For example, a clan primarily known for fishing may be called the "Fisher Clan". Orajans will always include their clan name. Those who are born in (or have survived the journey to) Contan often use the clan name as a surname instead.</p>
