# Continentia
Continentia is a new setting for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons. This repository will be for adding the additional content from this setting to your copy of [Aurora Builder](http://www.aurorabuilder.com). This repository also works best with the [Aurora Legacy Elements](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy/elements). 
To download Continentia content, use this index link in your copy of Aurora Builder - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkducklett/Continentia/main/Continentia.index

## Disclaimer
