        <description>
			<p class="flavor">Half-dragons, also called Half-mutts or Half-drakes, are a combination of two different races where one (or both) of which must be draconic.</p>
			<h4>APPEARANCE</h4>
			<p>Half-dragons will appear as a mix of both parents, and may share or lack traits of either of their parent.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Half-Icans.</i></b> Half-Icans will be shorter than their Ican parent, but usually will be taller than their non-Ican parent. They will usually have wings in their humanoid form, and may also have patches of scales. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Half-Illitians.</i></b> Half-Illitians will be taller than their Illitian parent, but usually will be shorter than their non-Illititian parent. They will usually have feathery wings in their humanoid form, and may also have patches of feathers as well as sharper claws.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Half-Khalids.</i></b> Half-Khalids will be bulky, but will typically be around the same size as both parents. They will have a noticeably colder body temperature, and may also have ridges on the bridge of their nose, like their Khalid parent. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Half-Nagaens.</i></b> Half-Nagaens will usually have their Nagean parent’s hair and eye color. They rarely will possess wings in their humanoid form. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Half-Orajans.</i></b> Half-Orajans often lack the heterochromia trait of their Orajan parent. They will usually have wings in their humanoid form, and may potentially either lack their second set of wings or have them permanently out even in humanoid form.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Half-Pyruvians.</i></b> Half-Pyruvians often possess their Pyruvian parent’s hair and eye color. They will usually have wings in their humanoid form, and often will be warmer to the touch. They will have noticeably warmer body temperature. </p>
			<h4>Of Two Races, But Belonging To Neither</h4>
			<p>Though common in Contintentia, Half-Dragons are seen as existing outside both cultures they were conceived from. It's a hard life to never truly belong to either the culture of your mother or your father, but it is the life these folk endure. The nature of their birth and parentage will affect how accepted they are in the overall culture of their land. Contan is by far the most accepting of Half-Dragons, but that's not saying much. Some in the Northernlands also care little about the nature of one's parentage. Arity has gotten better since their Civil War about Half-Dragons, but many provinces still look down upon those of mixed lines. While places like Ica remain to be the most hostile toward those of mixed lineage.</p>
            <h4>A Culture Built Off Exclusion</h4>
			<p>In defiance of their parents' culture, Half-Dragons often carve their own path in life. Some seek to embrace both aspects of their mixed parentage, enjoying the blessings of both parents. Others choose to denounce both parent's individual culture in service to making their own. Either way, many Half-Dragons pride themselves on being their own person, bound to neither side of their lineage.</p>
			<h4>HALF-DRAGON TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Half-Dragons possess the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Age.</i></b> Half-Dragons typically mature around the age of 18. Rarely will Half-Dragon's live as long as their draconic parent(s), at most, they usually live to be around 100.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Half-Dragons usually follow the alignment of one or both of their draconic parents. </p>
        	<p class="indent"><b><i>Size.</i></b> Half-dragons will usually be around the same height as their parents. Your size is medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You gain proficiency in two languages: one that is the common language of the country you grew up in, and the other is a language learned from one of the cultures of your parents.</p>
