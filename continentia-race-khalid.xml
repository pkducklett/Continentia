        <description>
		    <p class="flavor">Khalids tend to live in the Northern regions of Continentia, but have a distinct divide between urban and rural populations.</p>
		    <h4>APPEARANCE</h4>
		    <p>Khalids are known for their blue eyes and stocky build. Their skin is often pale. Khalid hair is generally light blue, but can also be white. They have small hornlike ridges going down their nose, as well as unnaturally large bottom canine teeth.</p>
			<h4>A HISTORY OF DIVIDE</h4>
			<p>Khalids have long been an elusive race, living far North where other races did not. For most of their history Khalids lived in separate communities across the Northernlands, with their own cultures and technologies. In fact, the word Khalid to describe the race as a whole is rather new and is derived from the confederation of tribes of the same name.</p>
			<p>Humans would arrive in the Northernlands and establish farming villages. Most Khalids saw humans as nothing to worry about, as most of them stayed to the South and mostly just wanted to trade. However, as more aggressive humans moved North, skirmishes did happen.</p>
			<h4>A PEOPLE OF TWO CULTURES</h4>
			<p>Khalids are a race who have a never ending search for knowledge, either scientific or mythical. After humans settled in their lands some Khalids moved South and integrated with the humans. While others stayed North to continue their culture of mysticism.</p>
			<h4>KHALID NAMES</h4>
			<p>Khalid names vary wildly due to their many sub groups. However, Khalid last names tend to end in “tun.”</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Male Names:</strong> Hallr, Björn, Emil, Jóhannes, Ragnar, Snorri, Arne</li>
				<li><strong>Female Names:</strong> Fríða, Katla, Brynhildr, Elsa, Asta, Camilla, Hilda</li>
				<li><strong>Surames:</strong> Haltun, Alvartun, Daltun, Lotun, Ötun, Södertun, Westertun</li>

			<p>Northern Khalids consider themselves the true race of Khalids. After human integration, they remained North to continue their traditions. Northern Khalids consider the Southern Khalmuts a blight on Khalid culture, and often try to ensure that Khalmuts can not enter Northern lands.</p>
			<p>Khalids rarely go South, but the ones that do are entrusted in providing for the tribe by trading with the humans.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Southern Khalmuts are a race of enterprising individuals. During the late 1700’s many Khalids moved South to integrate with human culture, in order to receive a human education. Because of this many Khalmuts moved away from their original culture, and have begun their own culture, rejecting the concept of mystics.</p>
			<p>Khalmuts considered the War of Three Knives in 1802, as the moment they were accepted as a race equal to humans. Because of this Khalmuts are drilled at a young age to know every detail of this war, and to look up to the Khalid generals who won it.</p>

Although much of their conquered land is gone, their culture remains. As the words that remain carved permanently in the rock of Ingarta say:</p>
